# justins-sslp-tools
A collection of tools for easing the creation of SSLPs

Currently contains only one tool: 
- nimsend, which uploads pictures to LPix, an image host for the Let's Play forum of Something Awful. At this time, Something Awful is the only place that still has this kind of LP.

More coming soon!
